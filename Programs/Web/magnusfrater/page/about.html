		<h1>About</h1>
		
		<div class="box">
			<h2>Who Am I?</h2>
			<p>My name is Todd Griffin. I am an 18 year old American-Canadian programmer attending Purdue University in West Lafayette, IN.</p>

		<div class="box">
			<h2>Background</h2>
			<p>I grew up in the burbs of Chi-Town in a village named Westmont. I lived there all my life right up until the summer before college, where I ended up moving to the next suburb over named Woodridge. I went to many great schools along my scholarly path, but the one that takes the cake was my high school, Downers Grove North. While there I got very invested in the band program as well as really got serious about a career in Computer Science.</p>

			<h2>Interests</h2>
			<h3><b>Programming:</b></h3>
			<p>I love it. If people ever want to know where I am at, it's probably at my battlestation. I am always working on projects ranging from fixing my personal website (it's never done), to writing a text-to-speech program using my own voice, to cloning video games to see how they work (and to expand my working portfolio).</p>
			
			<h3><b>Music:</b></h3>
			<p>Songs I'd love to be able to play on bass guitar include 'Ain't No Mountain High Enough' by Marvin Gaye & Tammi Terrel, and 'Sir Duke' by Stevie Wonder.</p>
			
			<h3><b>Food:</b></h3>
			<p>My favourite foods include any burrito place, any faux-asian-american place, and any hamburger joint. My favourite joint in Chicago is a place called Pockets on West Madison.</p>

			<h2>What Is 'magnus frater'??</h2>
			<p>'Magnus Frater' is Latin for 'Big Brother', and is my online alias. I first picked the name to be funny (you know, cause 1984), but it slowly started to grow on me. Eventually the name became such a part of my online status that I started to apply it to my CS-related works. Now I keep it as my personal website, GitHub, and steam alias.</p>
